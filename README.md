Repository to calculate phonons for multi-layered two-dimensional materials

Any "special" notes:
* Input POSCARs should never begin with 'POSCAR-'. i.e. 'POSCAR_(stuff)' is fine and 'POSCAR' is good but not 'POSCAR-stuff'. The automated analysis relies on this keyword to analyze phonon structures properly.
